## About The Project


https://muradhanki.github.io/Code-Quiz/index.html

Hi everyone! This is Muradhan. I am a construction project manager of 10 years whom always had an interest overt the IT industry. Finally decided to make the switch, and started the EdX's Front end development boot camp to switch his field of work. 

In this assignment, I am tasked to create an application that to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores. SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers. The app that I have written will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

The code quiz contains the following requirements:

* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
 
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  * 
  * When answer is clicked, the next question appears
  * 
  * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

  * When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score


The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
