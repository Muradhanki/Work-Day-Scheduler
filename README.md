## About The Project


https://muradhanki.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/

Hi everyone! This is Muradhan. I am a construction project manager of 10 years whom always had an interest overt the IT industry. Finally decided to make the switch, and started the EdX's Front end development boot camp to switch his field of work. 

In this assignment, I have created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. The app that I have written will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. 

The app contains the following requirements:

** Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
 
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
 
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
 
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page


The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
